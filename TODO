Move save() from views to forms

Sticky groups:
- When you join a 'sticky' group though inheritance, group membership should be permanent.

Invite groups:
- Disable invitation buttons when a group doesn't support the feature.

Use PermissionDenied exception rather than calling views.unauthorized() directly.

Check file url in group_detail.html

Check date is not null when creating an event

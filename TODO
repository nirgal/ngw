When adding someone in a group, check supergroups permission to add members.
Or just allow supergroup inherited...

Favorite groups.

Default supergroup(s).

Make a MultiWidget for flags, including javascript pre-checks/clears
Use CIGFLAGS_CODEDEPENDS & CIGFLAGS_CODEONDELETE
- in javascript checkbox
- in set_member_1
Fix perms: can_read_msg => can see members (?)
Show detailed membership in message_detail, including inherited.

Migrate to class based views:
Latest version of django offer view classes, with "get" "post" method. We could use that.
See *ListView classes

Sticky groups:
- When you join a 'sticky' group though inheritance, group membership should be permanent.

Invite groups (?):
- Disable invitation buttons when a group doesn't support the feature.

Check date is not null when creating an event

Check how slicing is optimized in ContactQuerySet

Fix ejabberd cross subscribe overrides:
Use "ejabberdctl add-rosteritem ..." rather than messing directly with ejabberd tables

Support Image contactfields

Global search widget (top right) should send to /contacts/ ? But what about the add_to button ?

Files handling:
- Improve display (mimetype, size, ...)
- Check cache/no cache
- Improve previews (tumbler package with d-bus commands and ajax integration?)

Event selection widget (Do not load everything at once, like for column selection)

Remove the "you are leaving that page" warning on column choice change.

Type change deletion check is buggy.

With django 1.6, ContactQuerySet no longer needs to inherit from RawQuerySet.

Add duration to events (end date)

Disallow sending message for an event today or in the past.

Show list of groups with unread messages on homepage.

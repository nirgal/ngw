BUGS
====================================================================================================

Calendar: Data is lost when user clic too quickly on prev/next. (Forwarded to https://github.com/xuanye/xgcalendar/issues/24)

====================================================================================================
VALIDATED IMPROVEMENTS
====================================================================================================

Modify inline editing for membership so that the Note can be edited too. This may completely replace groups.contactingroup_edit

Show messages counts on the member list.

On event creation, when start date is defined, set up the end date for a one day event.

@never_cache in views doesn't seem to work properly

====================================================================================================
CODE REFACTOR
====================================================================================================

Support Image contactfields.

Event selection widget. (Do not load everything at once, like for column selection)

Files handling:
- Improve display (mimetype, size, ...)
- Check cache/no cache.
- Improve previews (tumbler package with d-bus commands and ajax integration?)

With django 1.6, ContactQuerySet may no longer need to inherit from RawQuerySet: See internal cache in o2o sql compiler.
See also https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/lookups/
Extend contact quick search to logins.

Fix ejabberd cross subscribe overrides:
Use "ejabberdctl add-rosteritem ..." rather than messing directly with ejabberd tables

In group_members.html, show detailed permissions for get_manager_groups|group_visible_by:user.id

Improve double-choice filters.

Attach a choice to a field and only one (usefull for permissions) (but yes/no)
Allow group operator to modify their fields without being site-wide admin

Extensions: Change hooks for signals

On the contact detail page, have the events either in a separated page or in a widget.

Check unified authorization system in apache2.4, like
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_form.html
https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/pull/41

UNSORTED
====================================================================================================

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/releases/1.7/#custom-lookups

Make sure all form.save() support the commit parameter

Default supergroup(s).
Change "default group" into "default permissions"

Favorite groups.

Sticky groups:
- When you join a 'sticky' group though inheritance, group membership should be permanent.

Invite groups (?):
- Disable invitation buttons when a group doesn't support the feature.

Check date is not null when creating an event.

Add support for attachements in externals messages (?)

When adding someone in a group, check supergroups permission to add members.
Or just allow supergroup inherited...
TBD

Change MailmanSyncForm into a ModelForm (?)

Check new migrations framework

====================================================================================================
VALIDATED IMPROVEMENTS
====================================================================================================

Modify inline editing for membership so that the Note can be edited too. This may completely replace groups.contactingroup_edit

Show messages counts on the member list.

On event creation, when start date is defined, set up the end date for a one day event.

add_to_group: You need to be able to add contacts in all super groups, including hidden ones, and the ones where you don't change anything like contacts.

Group list is too slow. Period.


====================================================================================================
CODE REFACTOR
====================================================================================================

Support Image contactfields.

Event selection widget. (Do not load everything at once, like for column selection)

Files handling:
- Improve display (mimetype, size, ...)
- Check cache/no cache.
- Improve previews (tumbler package with d-bus commands and ajax integration?)

With django 1.6, ContactQuerySet may no longer need to inherit from RawQuerySet: See internal cache in o2o sql compiler.
See also https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/lookups/
Extend contact quick search to logins.

Fix ejabberd cross subscribe overrides:
Use "ejabberdctl add-rosteritem ..." rather than messing directly with ejabberd tables

In group_members.html, show detailed permissions for get_manager_groups|group_visible_by:user.id

Extensions: Change hooks for signals

On the contact detail page, have the events either in a separated page or in a widget.

Check unified authorization system in apache2.4, like
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_form.html
https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/pull/41

Global or Group filters

UNSORTED

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/releases/1.7/#custom-lookups

Default supergroup(s).
Change "default group" into "default permissions"

Favorite groups.

Sticky groups:
- When you join a 'sticky' group though inheritance, group membership should be permanent.

Invite groups (?):
- Disable invitation buttons when a group doesn't support the feature.

Check date is not null when creating an event.

Add support for attachements in externals messages (?)

When adding someone in a group, check supergroups permission to add members.
Or just allow supergroup inherited...
TBD

Change MailmanSyncForm into a ModelForm (?)

Check new migrations framework

Make an ldap compatible daemon

When adding someone in a group, check supergroups permission to add members.
Or just allow supergroup inherited...

Favorite groups.

Default supergroup(s).

Make a MultiWidget for flags, including javascript pre-checks/clears

Use CIGFLAGS_CODEDEPENDS & CIGFLAGS_CODEONDELETE
- in javascript checkbox
- in set_member_1

Migrate to class based views

Move save() from views to forms

Sticky groups:
- When you join a 'sticky' group though inheritance, group membership should be permanent.

Invite groups (?):
- Disable invitation buttons when a group doesn't support the feature.

Check date is not null when creating an event

Implement slicing in ContactQuerySet

(jpv) Remove pwgen dependency

Fix ejabberd cross subscribe overrides:
Use "ejabberdctl add-rosteritem ..." rather than messing with ejabberd tables

Support Image contactfields

Add table ContactMessageReadBy(msg_id, contact_id)

Global search widget (top right) should send to /contacts/ ? But what about add_to buttons and so on ?

Files handling:
- Improve display (mimetype, size, ...)
- Check cache/no cache
- Improve previews (tumbler package with d-bus commands and ajax integration?)

Event selection widget (Do not load everything at once, like for column selection)

Message sending to an inherited member.

Type change deletion check is buggy.

Delete Config item "group header".

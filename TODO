VALIDATED IMPROVEMENTS
====================================================================================================

On event creation, when start date is defined, set up the end date for a one day event.

add_to_group: You need to be able to add contacts in all super groups, including hidden ones, and the ones where you don't change anything like contacts.

Event selection widget. (Do not load everything at once, like for column selection)

Global or Group filters: Exemple "RÃ©gion" field
- Change user filters format to json in the database

On the contact detail page, have the events either in a separated page or in a widget.


====================================================================================================
CODE REFACTOR
====================================================================================================

Files handling:
- Improve display (mimetype, size, ...)
- Check cache/no cache.
- Make previews (tumbler package with d-bus commands and ajax integration?)

With django 1.6, ContactQuerySet may no longer need to inherit from RawQuerySet: See internal cache in o2o sql compiler.
See also https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/lookups/

Extend contact quick search to logins.

In group_members.html, show detailed permissions for get_manager_groups|group_visible_by:user.id

Extensions: Change hooks for signals

Check unified authorization system in apache2.4, like
https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_form.html
https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/mod_wsgi/pull/41

Make a nice display of group hierarchy.

Default supergroup(s).
Change "default group" into "default permissions"

Favorite groups (not for events?):
- Add a profile field to store the list of favorite groups (comma delimited?)
- Add a filter on group page on the right to show only favorite fields or all of them
- Add actions on group list to remove or add a group from/to the list of favorites.

Sticky groups:
- When you join a 'sticky' group though inheritance, group membership should be permanent.

Invite groups (?):
- Disable invitation buttons when a group doesn't support the feature.

Improve EditGroup form:
- Check date is not null when creating an event.
- Change permission setup: We need a way to add groups and for each of them to select the permissions
- Make a full wizard?
- Shouln't mailman extension be setup in its own table/extension?

Add support for attachements in externals messages (?)

When adding someone in a group, check supergroups permission to add members.
Or just allow supergroup inherited...
TBD

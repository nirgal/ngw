This ngw extension provide ejabberd authentication against django database.

/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg will need to contain something like:
{auth_method, external}.
{extauth_program, "/usr/lib/ngw/manage.py ejabberd_auth"}.


Also, you'll need to define some constants in your settings.py:

XMPP_DOMAIN should be the domain your xmpp server is offering

XMPP_GROUP is an integer and must be the ContactGroup containing users who
  are allowed to connect to the server. Adding and removing contacts from
  that group automatically grants and revoke permissions to connect to the
  jabber daemon.

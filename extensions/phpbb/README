Phpbb3 extension (optional)
===========================
Note: This section documentation is incomplete

Create a specific postgres user and database:
su - postgres -c "createuser --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole phpbb3"
su - postgres -c "psql -c '\password phpbb3'"
su - postgres -c "createdb phpbb3 -O phpbb3"

Install the packages:
aptitude install phpbb3 php5-pgsql php5-curl php5-cli sudo

You will want to setup things manually.
/etc/phpbb3/database.inc.php should contain something like:
<?php
##
## database access settings in php format
## automatically generated from /etc/dbconfig-common/phpbb3.conf
## by /usr/sbin/dbconfig-generate-include
## Mon, 08 Dec 2008 12:28:45 +0100
##
## by default this file is managed via ucf, so you shouldn't have to
## worry about manual changes being silently discarded.  *however*,
## you'll probably also want to edit the configuration file mentioned
## above too.
##
$dbuser='phpbb3';
$dbpass='superpassword';
$basepath='';
$dbname='phpbb3';
$dbserver='127.0.0.1';
$dbport='5432';
$dbtype='pgsql';
?>

In settings.py, you will need to:
* Enable the DATABASES "phpbb3", and fill in the password
* Enable the application in INSTALLED_APPS

The first time you install the database, you'll need to initialise it:
psql phpbb3  -h localhost -U phpbb3 -W -f /usr/share/dbconfig-common/data/phpbb3/install/pgsql
But you will generally prefer to restore a backup of phpbb3 database with that command:
psql phpbb3 -h localhost -U phpbb3 -f backup_phpbb3.sql

Make sure you have the same password in the two systems (ngw & phpbb3)

Then:
rm /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpbb3.conf

Add to your ngw/apache.conf:
    Include "/etc/phpbb3/apache2.conf"
    <Location "/phpbb/">
        require valid-user
	require group 53
    </Location>

In the admin control panel, in general, in client communication, in authentication, change authentication method from "Db" to "Apache".

Install french packs:
wget http://www.phpbb.com/files/language_packs_30x/lang_fr.tar.gz
wget http://www.phpbb.com/files/language_packs_30x/prosilver_fr.tar.gz
wget http://www.phpbb.com/files/language_packs_30x/subsilver2_fr.tar.gz
tar xvfz lang_fr.tar.gz -C /usr/share/phpbb3/www/language/
tar xvfz prosilver_fr.tar.gz -C /usr/share/phpbb3/styles/
tar xvfz subsilver2_fr.tar.gz -C /usr/share/phpbb3/styles/
If you retore a database, you have nothing more to do. If this is a fresh install, you'll need to log in the administrator control panel, go to system, then install the language.

and set it as default. Many settings should be customized, such as "activation du compte" in "RÃ©glage des inscriptions"; the fact that groups are closed; and so on...

In the admin control panel:
 General
  Board configuration
   Board settings
    Default Language = fr
 Permissions
  Global permissions
   Group' permissions
    Registered users
     Advanced permissions
      Profile
       Change email address = No
      -> Apply
 System
  Module Management
   User Control Panel
    disable all modules but profile


You need to patch phpbb3 in order to forward password change requests to ngw main database:

First make sure apt-get upgrades won't erase the patches automatically:
aptitude hold phpbb3

Apply the phpbb patches:
cd /usr/share/phpbb3/
patch -p1 < /home/admin/ngw/extensions/phpbb/phpbb_ngw.patch

If there is phpbb3 updates, you'll have to reapply the patch after each update.


The synchronisation between the 2 databases, the main one and the phpbb one require the auxiliary base to full its cache.

Right now, this is done with a sudo command. So you need to allow it. With visudo command as root, add this line:
ALL     ALL=(www-data) NOPASSWD: /usr/lib/ngw/extensions/phpbb/clearcache.php

You also will need to synchronise the 2 databases:
/usr/lib/ngw/extensions/phpbb/__init__.py full
Add to purge the cache:
sudo -u www-data /usr/lib/ngw/extensions/phpbb/clearcache.php

Right now, the phpbb forum runs on a different virtual host, so you'll need to enable it:
ln -s /usr/lib/ngw/extensions/phpbb/apache.conf /etc/apache/site-enabled/phpbb.conf
Don't forget to set up the main ngw databse in this file.


If you setup a backup script, you'll need to create a ~/.pgpass file for the user running the backups.
The .pgpass file syntax is available at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/interactive/libpq-pgpass.html
It might be something like:
localhost:5432:phpbb3:phpbb3:XXXXXXXX
Make sure the file is also protected locally:
localhost:~# chown www-data:www-data /var/www/.pgpass
localhost:~# chmod 600 /var/www/.pgpass
